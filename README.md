# GhidraChangeFunctionNamesAccordingToFirstString-
This Ghidra script automatically renames functions in a Ghidra project based on the first String object or wide character array found in each function. The script iterates over all functions in the current program and checks if their names start with “FUN_”. If a function’s name starts with “FUN_”, the script checks if the function is a thunk. If the function is a thunk, the script renames it by adding the prefix “THUNK_” to its name. If the function is not a thunk, the script searches for the first String object or wide character array in the function. If a String object or wide character array is found, the script renames the function based on it. The script removes spaces and file extensions from the String object or wide character array and uses it as the new name for the function.

This script can be useful for Ghidra users who want to automatically rename functions in their Ghidra projects based on String objects or wide character arrays found within them. The script can save time and effort compared to manually renaming functions one by one.
